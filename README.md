# Meeting Manager

```
Under development, but don't expect it to ever be released.
```

This web app assists me in creating assignments for the midweek life and ministry meeting.

## Live Reload (Chromium Only)

This web app includes an optional feature that uses the Chrome flag `#file-system-observer` to detect changes in the file system and automatically reload the app. This feature is only available for Chromium based browsers

1. **Navigate to Chrome Flags:**
   Type `chrome://flags` in the address bar and press Enter.

2. **Search for File System Observer:**
   Use the search bar on the flags page to find `#file-system-observer`.

3. **Enable the Flag:**
   Set the flag to `Enabled`.

4. **Restart Chrome:**
   Click the "Relaunch" button at the bottom of the page to restart Chrome with the flag enabled.
