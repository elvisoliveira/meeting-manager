# What Started Simple, Grew Complex

What began as a straightforward assignment management tool evolved organically into a more comprehensive system with:
- Announcement board rendering
- Multiple layout options
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Export functionality

## If I Were to Start Today

If this project was planned today, knowing what I know now, I would have made different architectural decisions:

### Storage Strategy
Instead of using `localStorage`, I would have implemented **OPFS (Origin Private File System)** for data persistence. This would provide:
- Better performance for larger datasets
- More reliable storage without size limitations
- Proper file-based organization
- Better data integrity and backup capabilities

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with scalability in mind** - Even simple tools can grow into complex systems
2. **Choose storage solutions wisely** - Consider future data needs, not just current ones
3. **Embrace organic growth** - Sometimes the best features come from unexpected use cases
4. **Document the journey** - Understanding how and why a project evolved helps with future decisions

This project serves as a reminder that software development is often more about adaptation and evolution than perfect initial planning.
